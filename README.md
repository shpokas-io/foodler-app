### Tought Process

#### Problem

- When dining out with friends or travelling, splitting the bill can be confusing, especially when multiple people pay for others.<br> Foodler solves this by calculating the exact amounts owed between friends, making it easy to settle debts without misunderstandings.

#### Features

- **Bill Splitting**: Users can input the total bill and how much each person paid, and the app calculates how much is owed.
- **Add Friends**: Users can easily add friends to the bill, with unique random icons for each friend.

#### Development Process

- I focused on making the app easy to use and visually clear. The bill-splitting algorithm was one of the key features and posed<br> some challenges during development. After some research, I found a helpful solution on Stack Overflow that provided a solid approach to handling the calculations for who owes whom.

#### Learning Outcome

- Building this app was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of **React props**, **state management**, and **hooks**.<br> I also enhanced my **JavaScript ES6** skills, particularly in working with ternary operators and spread operators to make the code more efficient.
